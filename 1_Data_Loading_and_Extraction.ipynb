    "The restaurant industry in Canada generated close to **$79 billion** in 2019 which accounted for **1.5%** of the country's GDP. More than **97,000 businesses**, which employ **6.4% (approximately 1.2 million people)** of country's total workforce constituted this 1.5% in 2019.  Given the significance of this industry, it’s size and employment numbers, I decided to create a model that could help business owners and investors determine the essential features that predict a restaurant’s success or failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this analysis, investors can decide whether they should invest at a particular business based on the likelihood that it is going to get closed in the future; existing businesses could intervene and improve upon those parameters whereas new businesses could analyze the potential before entering the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project was collected from **Yelp Open Dataset** which is publicly available as of Mar 16, 2021 for educational and academic purposes. The dataset's size is 11 GB with 5 json files on businesses, reviews, users, tips and checkin data. For this project, I have focused on businesses' and their reviews data. There are 160,585 businesses and 8,635,403 reviews in the complete dataset, but for this project, I have utilized the data for restaurants within Vancouver, British Columbia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, in part 1, we will start by importing the dataset and extracting the required data from .json files. In part 2, the data will be cleaned, primarily consisting of removing/imputing duplicates and null values and subsequently, project feature engineering will be performed to create custom data columns that can help in predicting success/failure of a restaurant. This is then followed by an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the final cleaned dataset. In part 3 of the project, models will be build and evaluated on various performance parameters."
